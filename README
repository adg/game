This is an example game 'Flappy Gopher' that was
written for my keynote at GoCon Tokyo Winter 2015.

This game is now an official example in the x/mobile repository.
Its canonical location is golang.org/x/mobile/example/flappy (use 'go get').

The git history shows the step-by-step development of the game.
When I gave the keynote, I demonstrated this using the dt tool.
